The main goal of this project was to update the code to follow accessibility standards in order to optimize the site for search engines.

To achieve these goals I've done the following

* Updated the HTML with semantic tags as per accessibility standards
* Added comments to help digest the HTML
* Added alternative descriptions for images
* Added a site title
* Consolidated repetitive CSS and updated the properties when needed
